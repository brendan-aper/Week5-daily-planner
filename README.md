 ## Usage
 Here's a brief guide on how to use the Daily Planner:

  * Upon opening the application, you will see a table representing the hours of the day.
  * Each row corresponds to the hour, starting from 9 AM to 5 PM.
  * Click on a time slot to input or edit a task for that hour.
  * Once you have entered your task, click the save button to store it.
  * The time slots will be color-coded to indicate past, present, and future tasks.
  * To edit or delete a task, simply click on the respective time slot and make the desired changes.
  * The application automatically saves your schedule using local storage, so your data will persist even if you close or refresh the page.
